# Prime Numbers Big Bang Generator

This Java program generates an array of numbers and replaces certain values with words based on divisibility rules. It is inspired by the concept of two prime numbers colliding and causing a big bang. The program identifies numbers divisible by 3, numbers divisible by 5, and numbers divisible by both 3 and 5, replacing them with specific words.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (such as Eclipse).

3. Locate the `PrimeNumbers.java` file in the project structure.

4. Run the `PrimeNumbers.java` file as a Java application.

5. The program will generate an array of numbers from 1 to 100, replacing specific values as follows:
   - Numbers divisible by 3 will be replaced with the word "BIG".
   - Numbers divisible by 5 will be replaced with the word "BANG".
   - Numbers divisible by both 3 and 5 will be replaced with the phrase "BIG BANG".

6. The generated array will be saved to an `output.json` file in the project directory.
